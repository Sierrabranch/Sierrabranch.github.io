This is my last full week as a CEAMLS participant and as i reflect im greatful for all that i have learned. The week, we focoused on our main presentation aswell our abstract and Final paper. I spent alot of time practicing infront dfferent people in the office and listening to thier critiques. I also spent alor of time on the graphics used for my presentation, which i had never done before and am pleased with how they came out.
