This week, 

my groupmates and I focoused on gathering data, and zoned in on PM2.5 and how the aerosol affects us. We reviwed literature and compared the findings of our reaserch to what we knew and the data we gathered. We also looked at diffrent ways to gather information around campus. Lastly we got to see the new drone.
